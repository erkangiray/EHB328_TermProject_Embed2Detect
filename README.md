# EHB328_TermProject_Embed2Detect
Forked from https://github.com/HHansi/Embed2Detect for my EHB 328 Term Project at Istanbul Tech Uni

I am taking the course 'EHB-328' at Istanbul Technical University. For our term project we are expected to pick an academic research project, run its codes and demonstrate how it works. For this I picked 'Embed2Detect'. The article by Hettiarachchi, H., Adedoyin-Olowe, M., Bhogal, J. et al. can be found at this link:

Look at 'Main_Embed2Detect_Giray.ipynb' to see the Jupyter Notebook that I am writing to run the Embed2Detect codes.
