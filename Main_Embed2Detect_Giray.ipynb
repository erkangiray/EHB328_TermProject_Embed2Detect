The explanation on Google was:<blockquote>Is TSV a TXT file?<br>They are all text files, following the same \"guidelines\". The difference between the files are - as long as the creator followed some \"rules\", that: A csv file will have comma separated values and a tsv file will have tab seperated values.</blockquote>\n",

The ground truth files contain some keywords contained in [] brackets, but they don't make any sense to me. I can't figure out which would serve as our 'munliv.tsv'."
